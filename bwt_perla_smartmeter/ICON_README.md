# Icon & Logo

This directory should contain:

- **icon.png** (128x128 px): Smaller icon for the add-on store
- **logo.png** (128x128 px): Larger logo for the add-on details page

## Recommendation

Create images with:
- Blue/water theme (representing BWT water softener)
- Simple, recognizable design
- PNG format with transparency
- Resolution: 128x128 pixels minimum

## Tools

You can create these with:
- Inkscape (free vector graphics)
- GIMP (free image editor)
- Canva (online design tool)
- Figma (online design tool)

## Placeholder

Until custom icons are created, you can use the Home Assistant default icons.
To add your own icons, simply replace this file with `icon.png` and `logo.png`.
